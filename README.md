# Wave-function-collapse algorithm with Unity
This Unity example project utilizes the wave-function-collapse algorithm to procedurally generate levels on a two-dimensional grid.

## About this project
Using Unity version `2019.1.14f1`.

**Note:**
This implementation of the WFC-algorithm does not include any error correction but since the module set in this project is complete the algorithm will not run into any error state.
